# Testing

## Test 1 - Different Resin Conductivity

### Controled Variables

these variables will change the analog readings. thus we must control them to get accurate and reliable tests.

|variable|unit|method|
|--------|----|------|
|electrode diameter|mm|use same ones|
|electrode distance|mm|made 3d model|
|electrode depth|mm|made 3d model,conduct test in beaker|
|analog ref voltage|V|5V lm7805 aref|
|divider resistence|ohm|1 megaohm resistor|

- electrodes must be placed in parallel, such that at any given vertical point the distance between electrodes remains the same


### Independent Variable 
Resin Type

### Dependent Variable
Analog Reading

### Results

electrode diameter - 1.5mm
electrode distance - 4.0mm (from centre of electrodes)
